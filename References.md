## SourceCred

[SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/cred/) has a good set of properties, including the fact that cred is alway flowing away from you (much like it makes no sense to hoard your own points in Morat).

Their focus is on contributions that could be easily gameable and, in the end, they wanted it to act as money, which is something I am actively trying to avoid.

## Circles

[Circles](https://joincircles.net/) is an alternative currency for basic income, which stopped operations on January 2024. It was meant as a currency, which is something Morat actively tries to avoid, and thus did not impose any rules on transfer or scoring. It's much closer to a blockchain-based fureai kippu than a reputation system.

## Matrix

The team behind Matrix had a post in 2020 about [a per-server reputation system](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/), where each server could then export their reputation feeds and others could decide on their own how to compose it.

I like the idea, and it is the closest I've found to what I am trying to accomplish with Morat. Reputation streams are likely the easiest way to use consider some reputation sources as positive and others as negative, and I intend to experiment with them in Morat.
